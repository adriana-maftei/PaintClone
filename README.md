This project is a Paint clone app - a classic Windows application for drawing - made with Visual Studio & C# programmming language. The EXE file is available in the "bin" folder.
Main features I learned and build while developing this project:
- working with WinForms
- making UI elements (buttons, interactions)
- learning mouse events
- generating pixels in mouse position
- creating drawing forms (circle, rectangle, lines), color brush, color filler, color picker, eraser
- creating a functional save system for JPEG files
- creating dialog boxes for color picking and file saving
- working with VS tools and properties features
- build an executable file from a VS solution
